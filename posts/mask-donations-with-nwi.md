## More Donations:

“I was at Holt High School pitching a safety presentation to the staff. In conversation, it was
discovered that they could use extra masks to help slow/prevent the spread of COVID... I
contacted Trooper Young and without hesitation, he donated 1000 masks and immediately
stated, ‘Reg, who’s next?’ Trooper Young is truly a servant and I’m certain that his chain of
command and Troopers who work with him will agree.”
- Senior Reginal King, Alabama Law Enforcement Agency
