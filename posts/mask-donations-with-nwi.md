## More Donations:

“I was at Holt High School pitching a safety presentation to the staff. In conversation, it was
discovered that they could use extra masks to help slow/prevent the spread of COVID... I
contacted Trooper Young and without hesitation, he donated 1000 masks and immediately
stated, ‘Reg, who’s next?’ Trooper Young is truly a servant and I’m certain that his chain of
command and Troopers who work with him will agree.”
- Senior Reginal King, Alabama Law Enforcement Agency

Bibb County Commissioners heard two items regarding housing during their commission meeting on Tuesday, January 26.
The first was a single family homeownership unit to be built on Roy Avenue in partnership with Habitat for Humanity.
The second, a combination of duplex to be built on Ernest Street and the renovation of another single-family home on Duncan Avenue.
“And these are areas where you don’t usually see new structures and so this, to me, is just a good sign and it enhances the neighborhood,” said Commissioner Elaine Lucas during the meeting.
Neighborhood Works would be partnered for the second item.
