## What We Do:

We have renovated numerous properties all across the metro Atlanta area, beautifying
communities and providing an effective outlet for those who wish to make a positive
change in their environments. Through our efforts working with local contractors, we
have turned people who have never owned properties before into first-time homeowners.

## Quality Affordable Housing Empowers Communities

NWI believes affordable housing is an important step towards community empowerment and sustainable economic development. NWI works with experienced professionals to acquire and rehabilitate vacant foreclosed housing to meet or exceed HUD standards. Our finished homes are sold to qualified first-time homebuyers with a subsidy to ensure affordability for 5 or more years.

## Vision

Be a valued resource to all residents of the communities in which we work regardless of age, race, religious affiliation, national origin, family size, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, or physical ability, who seek to have access to safe, decent housing that is affordable.

## Mission

Neighborhood Works Inc.â€™s mission is to work diligently to empower community life by developing quality affordable housing that improves neighborhoods and supports essential community institutions.

## Internship Program

Internships at Neighborhood Works are an opportunity for us to invest in our community of young people. We are dedicated to providing a wholesome internship experience for high schoolers and college students in the Atlanta area who are looking to gain leadership experience in the non-profit space. Our previous interns come from prestigious universities such as Florida A&M UNiversity, and they partner with local internship programs. If you are a student interested in learning more about community development, housing development and how non-profits operate, you will leave our internship experience with fresh eyes and new skills!
